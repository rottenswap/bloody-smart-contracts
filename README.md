### What is BLOODY?

BLOODY is a deflationary elastic experiment that clots if it doesn't circulate.

### How does clotting work?

Whenever the BLOODY transfer volume increases, everyone's BLOODY balance gets a little bit bigger, whenever the BLOODY transfer volume decreases, everyone's BLOODY balance gets a little bit smaller.

### How is it deflationary?

Whenever there's a BLOODY transfer, it spills. The faster it circulates, the higher the spill rate.

### How often are rebases?

Hourly. After a rebase, transfers are frozen for 5 minutes.

### How are BLOODY liquidity provider incentivized?

- Half the spills are redistributed to BLOODY liquidity providers (up to 6% of ANY transfer).
- A BLOODY-ROT pool will be added to Rottenswap on Halloween.

### How is BLOODY initially distributed?

BLOODY cannot be minted, it is ditributed once on Halloween 2020 to ROT holders with a balance above 7,500. The snapshot block (11106871) was chosen at random https://twitter.com/TheTimTempleton/status/1320722096578727937

### Are contracts audited?

BLOODY is written 100% from scratch, not tested nor audited. It is NOT secure, use at your own risk.
